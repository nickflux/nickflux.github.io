  <h3>About Me</h3>

  <p>I am the CTO of <a href='https://www.givey.com' title='Givey'>Givey</a>.</p>

  <p>The last big work thing I did before that was build <a href='http://www.academiccharts.com/' title='Academic Charts Online'>Academic Charts Online</a>.</p>

  <p>Before that I had my own business called Super Simple Shop.</p>

  <p>Prior to that, other technology things.</p>

  <p>For a while, ennui.</p>

  <p>Backing up a bit more: music, laughter and a naive hope in all people.</p>

  <p>Earlier still I was a known as <em>The Living Thunderclap</em>.</p>

  <h3>About You</h3>

  <p>You are somewhere in between being almost-entirely-not-at-all and very interested in me. See above.</p>
