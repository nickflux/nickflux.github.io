title: Matthew Yglesias Loves Amazon

[Matthew Yglesias][1] cannot get enough of [Amazon][2]. He writes [Moneybox][3] for Slate, one of my favourite blogs, and a full 15% of his articles (not an accurate number) are about how Amazon is [the most amazing company in the world][4]. Mr Yglesias thinks that because

> Amazon, as best I can tell, is a charitable organization being run by elements of the investment community for the benefit of consumers.

Or to put it another way:

> But here's a comparison. Amazon's market capitalization—the price of all the outstanding shares in the company—is about $125 billion today. Apple's is about $385 billion. So Apple is about three Amazons. But Apple earns about $104 million in profit per day. Amazon earns less than that in a whole quarter. Yet Amazon's shares are rising while Apple's are slumping. That's what makes Bezos such a remarkable figure. And I really do think he should be applauded for it. Earning big profits and paying out dividends is boring. Building a company that grows and grows and grows is amazing.

Even Jeff Bezos has noticed his affection, [quoting him in a letter to shareholders][5]. And for all his writing Yglesias still can't get over the fact that [shareholders give Amazon free rein to make very little profit][6].

He's also interested in [acquisitions they make][7], what it must be like to [compete with them][8], and a recent favourite of mine: Amazon's own program of [quantitative easing][9], which should help solve the Kindle Fire's problem of competing with iOS for developer attention without needing to predict what its users want.

Sometimes, though, presumably when he's having a bad day, it can seem like [Amazon is a black hole threatening to devour corporate America][10].
